Basic card game War for ATC-CS class

IDK really what to put here, soooo...

Hi Mush! Getting this whole Git thing to work is kinda confusing, but I should be able to figure it out before long!
I still don't have a way to check when someone wins, so you'll just have to reset the program whenever a deck empties.


To play, just drag a card from your deck (the bottom right) to the center by clicking on the deck. Then click on the center to add the card to the middle.
